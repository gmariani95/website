Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD student in Economics at [ECARES](https://ecares.ulb.be/) (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles).

I hold a Mres Degree in Economics and Statistics from ECARES (2021). Here you can find my [CV]().

In My research I use a combination of spatial and administrative data to study two dimensions of inequality: housing and consumption of public goods. My agenda is supported by a research grant from the [F.R.S. - F.N.R.S.](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/)

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:giovanni.paolo.mariani@ulb.be) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
