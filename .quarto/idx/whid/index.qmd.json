Housing is the most important and evenly distributed asset throughout the income or wealth distribution. It is, therefore, crucial to understand wealth inequality. According to OECD estimates, housing consumption accounts for 10 to 30% of household consumption in OECD countries. It is, therefore, crucial to understand income and consumption inequality. Finally, owning or renting a house in a neighborhood is the only way to benefit from (or be harmed by) neighborhood effects, impacting outcomes as vital as social mobility. As the \"door of entry to neighborhoods,\" housing is critical to understanding inequality in opportunities.\n\n2.  **Cross-country comparability.** Compared to other data sources, cadastral data is relatively homogeneous across (at least Western) countries. That translates into high cross-country comparability.\n\n3.  **Administrative boundaries are not problematic.** Cadastral data is typically geolocated, which implies that arbitrary or changing administrative boundaries do not pose a problem in analyzing the data at any desired level of aggregation.\n\n4.  **Top coding is not a problem.** Cadastral data typically includes information on the universe of real estate in a given location. Therefore, censoring at the top is not a problem, and imputation methods are less often required.\n\n5.  **Analysis over time.** Because the year of construction is a variable typically included in cadastres, it is possible to construct a panel of real estate at any level of aggregation at any point in time, with caveats.\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 4em;\">\n## Preliminary results\n</div>\n\nThe exhibits below illustrate preliminary housing inequality results, showcasing and highlighting the advantages inherent in cadastral data described earlier.\n\n![Figure 1.
