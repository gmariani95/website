Here you can find my CV.\nIn My research I use a combination of spatial and administrative data to study two dimensions of inequality: housing and consumption of public goods. My agenda is supported by a research grant from the F.R.S. - F.N.R.S.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "Coming in the September 2025,\nThe World Housing Inequality Database (WHID) will be a cross-country harmonized database with housing inequality estimates available at different levels of aggregation. All estimates will be constructed using high-quality administrative data based on the universe of properties in a given country (cadasters).\nWHID estimates will be publicly available.\nThe first version of the database will include the following countries: United States, Belgium, and Spain.\nG. Doemench-Arumi (VanderbiltU) is a co-founder and collaborator in this project.\nG. Doemench-Arumi gratefully acknowledges funding and logistic support from the Fonds Thiepolam (Fondation ULB) and the Data with Purpose Program (Regrid).\nThe exhibits below illustrate preliminary housing inequality results, showcasing and highlighting the advantages inherent in cadastral data described earlier.\nThis figure shows disparities in (assessed) housing value in the United States. Our state-level estimates are constructed from the universe of US parcels drawn from county assessors. Because different counties assess properties applying different methodologies, a future version of this figure will rely on predicted house values from real estate transactions.\nThis figure shows inequality in the space (square meters) of new housing inflows in Spain’s largest cities from the beginning of the 20th Century until 2020. Each point in the map indicates the level of inequality of inflows in the previous decade in a specific city. For example, the “BCN” label from 1910 indicates that the housing space inequality of new dwellings constructed between 1900 and 1910 was 0.3.\nThe figure is produced using the 2020 cadastre. It showcases its potential to study inequality over time from one cross-section (with caveats – e.g., demolitions are not observed)."

    "text": "Do Public Goods Actually Reduce Inequality? (with M. Castanheira & C. Tricaud )\n\n\nAbstract\n\nPublic goods are meant to be universal, but they are inherently place-based. This paper systematically measures spatial access to public goods and quantifies the implications of distance to public facilities for income inequality. First, we map all schools and hospitals across Belgium. We compute the distance to facilities for each of the 20,000 neighborhoods and document large spatial inequalities in access to public facilities. Second, we find that this unequal distribution favors high-income neighborhoods: allocating public goods spending proportionally to our access index increases income inequality compared to measures based solely on disposable income. Third, we show that the positive relationship between income and access can be rationalized by a simple model of public goods allocation with an inequality-neutral social planner. Finally, we provide evidence that access is strongly correlated with educational and health outcomes, emphasizing the need to consider the place-based nature of public goods when measuring inequality.\n\nHousing inequality in Spain (Working Paper Available Soon) (with G. Doemench-Arumi)\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe use data on the universe of real estate in Spain and recent real estate transactions in Catalonia to construct novel contemporaneous and long-run housing inequality estimates for Spain at all existing levels of aggregation. Housing inequality in Spain is large, with the top 1% most spacious and valuable dwellings accruing over 6% of total residential space (square meters) and value. These estimates put Spain in between the US and Belgium in terms of inequality. Long-run series show that space inequality was much higher at the beginning of the 20th Century and declined significantly in the 1960s, coinciding with a boom in housing supply. Housing value inequality increased between 2009 and 2019, likely due to cyclical changes in aggregate demand and stagnating new housing supply. We document significant heterogeneity across all levels of aggregation and a correlation between housing value and income inequality, suggesting a connection between the two. This research introduces a new publicly available database to study housing-related topics and highlights the importance of granularity when evaluating policies related to inequality and housing."
